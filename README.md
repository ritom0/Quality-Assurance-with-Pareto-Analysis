🏍️ VoltRide Motorworks – Quality & Glitch Analysis (Excel Project)
[](#-voltride-motorworks--quality--glitch-analysis-excel-project)

📝 Project Overview
[](#-project-overview)
This project analyzes manufacturing and on-road “glitches” across key motorcycle components to identify where severe vs minor issues occur and how they impact bikes, suppliers, and road conditions.
The goal is to prioritize fixes using Pareto-style views, track unique affected bikes, and guide supplier and test-process improvements. 

📂 File Structure
[](#-file-structure)
The workbook (CSV-backed) contains the following logical views: 
- Major vs Minor Summary → Total glitches, severity split, and per-part major/minor counts
- Parts Pareto (Major) → Ranked major glitches by component with cumulative share.
- Supplier Pareto (Major) → Ranked supplier impact with cumulative share. 
- Glitch Frequency by Bike → Count of bikes with 1, 2, 3 glitches. 
- Minor by Road Condition → Wet, Hills, Dry, Bad Roads breakdown for each part. 
- KPI Block → Bikes sold, bikes with glitches, glitches per bikes sold. 


📈 Insights
[](#-insights)
- Exhaust System and Speedometer are the top major-defect drivers, so they should be the first focus for corrective action.
- Supplier impact is concentrated; engaging the top two suppliers can rapidly reduce major issues. 
- Minor glitches increase under Bad Roads (and sometimes Hills), suggesting condition-specific testing and reinforcement. 
- A subset of bikes faces multiple glitches, pointing to targeted service campaigns and deeper traceability.


🧭 Business Actions
[](#-business-actions)
- Prioritize Exhaust System and Speedometer lines for audits, test coverage, and containment.
- Launch supplier corrective action plans starting with ChildLock Pro and AirShield Technologies.
- Strengthen condition-specific validation (Bad Roads, Hills) for shock absorbers, brakes, speedometers, and transmissions. 
- Track repeat-affected bikes for proactive service and root-cause tracing at model/component level.

🛠️ Tools & Skills Demonstrated
[](#-tools--skills-demonstrated)
- Excel/Google Sheets → Pivoting, Pareto (cumulative sum and %), stacked bars, KPI blocks.
- Data Analytics → Severity segmentation, environment-based breakdown, frequency analysis. 
- Quality Engineering → Supplier attribution, part-level prioritization, defect-rate context vs sales. 
- Business Insights → Actionable prioritization, supplier focus, condition-aware testing strategy.
